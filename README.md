A very simple website project on the theme Mario Club for me to practice HTML and CSS.
It uses CSS layout & position, Pseudo Classes & Elements, and Media Queries.

1. Added a simple Mario game using CSS animation. Hover your cursor on the Mario to make it drive to the end point.
2. Changed the original :hover li picture from simple (top: -10px;)motion to CSS animation for a smoother transition effect.
